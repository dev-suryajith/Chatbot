# ðŸŽ“ Admission Chatbot

A Smart, NLP-Powered Chatbot to Automate Admission Processes

## Project Overview

At **Archon Solutions**, an innovative tech solutions firm, I developed an **admission-related chatbot** to automate major admission processes and efficiently manage student inquiries.

This chatbot is built using **Python (Django), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL** and integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand user questions and provide real-time responses.

The chatbot is fully responsive and works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile platforms, significantly reducing manual intervention and improving the institutionâ€™s online query management system.

## Key Features

* Automated admission queries for faster, more efficient response handling.
* Integrated Natural Language Processing (NLP) for real-time, relevant answers.
* Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
* Cross-platform compatibility for a smooth user experience.
* Streamlined online query management with minimal manual effort.

## Tech Stack

* Backend: Python (Django)
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Database: MySQL
* NLP: spaCy, NLTK, SymSpell, YAKE
